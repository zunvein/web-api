New info: This source code is currently broken, but it sometimes still works. I'm too lazy to fix it, so feel free to take on the task. 

Mb if the API is slow; I'm using 8x 4GB RAM on Replit, which is kinda small. All bugs are fixed now (i think???), and it should work 99% of the time(99 out of 738473882). If it's not working, blame Replit because they're not great. If Replit sucks, I'm considering switching to Railway, Cyclic, or Vercel.

Currently, I'm using Replit to deploy this project. If you're concerned about the API being turned off, don't worry, it's always on at (maybe, as long as my education plan on replit was not expired ðŸ˜… ) https://api.specstor.me.
